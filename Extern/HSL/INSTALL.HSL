Installation of certain Harwell subroutines for IPOPT.

*********************************************************************

      download and use this third party package.

THIS FILE HAS NOT YET BEEN UPDATED FOR THE C++ VERSION OF IPOPT.
FOR NOW, ALL YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD ARE THE ROUTINES:

  MA27
  MC19



Information on the Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL) is available at

http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/nag/hsl/

Some of the required HSL routines are available in the HSL Archive.
The subroutines in the HSL Archive are free for non-commercial
purposes (make sure you read the license).

Unless you want to use Ipopt with very special features, all you need
is either MA57 and MC30 (if you have access for the standard HSL
library) or MA27 and MC19 (if you have only access to the HSL
Archive). So, if you not sure if you need more than those subroutines,
chances are that you really don't need them.  (For some details on
what the individual routines are needed for, you can consult the
COIN/Ipopt/doc/INSTALL file.)

Instructions on how to download files from the HSL Archive:
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you need to download subroutines from the HSL Archive website, this
is how it goes:

In order to download the HSL Archive subroutines (like ma27 and mc19),
you need to register at the HSL Archive website

http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/hslarchive.html

After that you can log in and go to the page that lists all the HSL
Archive packages for download.  If you then click on the name of the
desired routine (like MA27), you get to a download page, where one of
the button reads "Download Package (comments removed)".

Click on that button (leave the precision choice at default "Double
Precision").  This brings up a webpage which contains the code for the
subroutine as text.  All you have to do now is to save this page (all
of it, even if there are more than one subroutines in it) into the a
file called "ma27ad.f".  (If "Save page to..." doesn't work, you can
copy the content of this page into an editor and save it there.)

Similarly, if you want to get the MC19 routine, do the same steps as above
and safe the context in a file called "mc19ad.f" .

For neither MA27 or MC19 it is necessary to download any dependencies.
(This is different for MA28, but only specialized usage of Ipopt requires
this package.)

Note:  If you are trying to locate certain routines in the HSL Archive,
       such as MA28, you will not find its dependencies listed in the
       HSL Archive Content list individually (e.g. for MA28, the
       routine MC13 is not in the list).  However, you can obtain
       those missing routine by downloading the "Dependencies" of the
       particular package.  If you want to use the Makefile provided
       in this directory, you will then have to copy the source for
       those individual subroutines into their own files
       (e.g. mc13ad.f, see below).
       Again, if you only want to use MA27 and MC19 (which is enough
       for most cases), no additional dependencies are required.

Instructions on where to put the source code:
---------------------------------------------

Copy the source files for the required HSL routines into this
directory before running the `configure' script.  The configuration
script will detect which source files you have and prepare the
Makefile accordingly.

Here is the list of required files for each "component":

MA27:  ma27ad.f

MA47:  ma47ad.f

MA57:  fd05ad.f ma57ad.f mc34ad.f mc47ad.f mc59ad.f mc71ad.f

MA28:  ma28ad.f	ma30ad.f mc13dd.f mc20ad.f mc21ad.f mc22ad.f
       mc23ad.f mc24ad.f

MA48:  fd05ad.f ma48ad.f ma50ad.f ma51ad.f mc13dd.f mc21ad.f mc41ad.f

MC30:  mc30ad.f

MC19:  mc19ad.f

MC29:  mc29ad.f

MC35:  mc20ad.f mc35ad.f

MC39:  mc39ad.f


Note: Make sure, you have the correct version of fd05ad.f for your
      operating system (if required).  FD05 is used to determine
      machine dependent quantities.  In some cases, you might have the
      source code for different versions of this routine available
      (e.g. fd05ads.f for standard IEEE).  If the configure script
      cannot find OTHERS/HSL/fd05ad.f, it tries to guess what version
      (such as fd05ads.f) is the correct one, and look for that source
      file instead.
      (Not required if you only use MA27 and MC19).
