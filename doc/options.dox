\page OPTIONS %Ipopt %Options

\tableofcontents

%Ipopt has many (maybe too many) options that can be adjusted for the
algorithm. %Options are all identified by a string name,
and their values can be of one of three types: Number (real), Integer,
or String. Number options are used for things like tolerances, integer
options are used for things like maximum number of iterations, and
string options are used for setting algorithm details, like the NLP
scaling method. %Options can be set through the code that interfaces %Ipopt
(have a look at the examples to see how this is done)
or by creating a `ipopt.opt` file in the directory you are executing %Ipopt.

The `ipopt.opt` file is read line by line and each line should contain the
option name, followed by whitespace, and then the value. Comments can be
included with the `#` symbol. For example,

    # This is a comment

    # Turn off the NLP scaling
    nlp_scaling_method none

    # Change the initial barrier parameter
    mu_init 1e-2

    # Set the max number of iterations
    max_iter 500

is a valid `ipopt.opt` file.

\section OPTIONS_AMPL Options in the AMPL Interface

To set options through AMPL, use the internal AMPL command options.
For example,
\verbatim
options ipopt_options "nlp_scaling_method=none mu_init=1e-2 max_iter=500"
\endverbatim
is a valid options command in AMPL. Further, you can always create `ipopt.opt`.
Note, the `ipopt.opt` file is given preference when setting options.
This way, you can easily override any options set in a particular executable
or AMPL model by specifying new values in `ipopt.opt`.

All %Ipopt options are also available through AMPL.
In addition, these options are available:

| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| halt_on_ampl_error | Exit with message on evaluation error |
| wantsol | solution report without -AMPL: sum of; 1 => write .sol file; 2 => print primal variable values; 4 => print dual variable values; 8 => do not print solution message |
| maxit | Synonym for \ref OPT_max_iter "max_iter" |
| outlev | Synonym for \ref OPT_print_level "print_level" |

Running the AMPL solver executable with the "-=" flag from the command prompt
prints a list of all options available in AMPL.

\section OPTIONS_REF Options Reference

A list of documented options is given next.
Options that should be modified by expert users only are marked as <em>advanced</em>.
You can print the documentation for all %Ipopt options to the console by
using the option \ref OPT_print_options_documentation "print_options_documentation"
and running %Ipopt.
If you have the AMPL solver executable, you can generate this list also
by calling the executable with flag `--print-options`.

\note Availability or default values of some options concerning the linear solver depends on the configuration used to build %Ipopt.
Use the print options documentation feature to see which options are available in a particular build of %Ipopt.

The implementation paper mentioned for some options is \cite WaecBieg06:mp.


\subsection OPT_Termination Termination

\anchor OPT_tol
<strong>tol</strong>: Desired convergence tolerance (relative).
<blockquote>
 Determines the convergence tolerance for the algorithm. The algorithm terminates successfully, if the (scaled) NLP error becomes smaller than this value, and if the (absolute) criteria according to "dual_inf_tol", "constr_viol_tol", and "compl_inf_tol" are met. This is epsilon_tol in Eqn. (6) in implementation paper. See also "acceptable_tol" as a second termination criterion. Note, some other algorithmic features also use this quantity to determine thresholds etc. The valid range for this real option is 0 < tol and its default value is 10<sup>-08</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_s_max
<strong>s_max</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Scaling threshold for the NLP error.
<blockquote>
 See paragraph after Eqn. (6) in the implementation paper. The valid range for this real option is 0 < s_max and its default value is 100.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_max_iter
<strong>max_iter</strong>: Maximum number of iterations.
<blockquote>
 The algorithm terminates with a message if the number of iterations exceeded this number. The valid range for this integer option is 0 &le; max_iter and its default value is 3000.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_max_wall_time
<strong>max_wall_time</strong>: Maximum number of walltime clock seconds.
<blockquote>
 A limit on walltime clock seconds that Ipopt can use to solve one problem. If during the convergence check this limit is exceeded, Ipopt will terminate with a corresponding message. The valid range for this real option is 0 < max_wall_time and its default value is 10<sup>+20</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_max_cpu_time
<strong>max_cpu_time</strong>: Maximum number of CPU seconds.
<blockquote>
 A limit on CPU seconds that Ipopt can use to solve one problem. If during the convergence check this limit is exceeded, Ipopt will terminate with a corresponding message. The valid range for this real option is 0 < max_cpu_time and its default value is 10<sup>+20</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_dual_inf_tol
<strong>dual_inf_tol</strong>: Desired threshold for the dual infeasibility.
<blockquote>
 Absolute tolerance on the dual infeasibility. Successful termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) dual infeasibility is less than this threshold. The valid range for this real option is 0 < dual_inf_tol and its default value is 1.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_constr_viol_tol
<strong>constr_viol_tol</strong>: Desired threshold for the constraint and variable bound violation.
<blockquote>
 Absolute tolerance on the constraint and variable bound violation. Successful termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) constraint violation is less than this threshold. If option bound_relax_factor is not zero 0, then Ipopt relaxes given variable bounds. The value of constr_viol_tol is used to restrict the absolute amount of this bound relaxation.  The valid range for this real option is 0 < constr_viol_tol and its default value is 0.0001.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_compl_inf_tol
<strong>compl_inf_tol</strong>: Desired threshold for the complementarity conditions.
<blockquote>
 Absolute tolerance on the complementarity. Successful termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) complementarity is less than this threshold. The valid range for this real option is 0 < compl_inf_tol and its default value is 0.0001.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_acceptable_tol
<strong>acceptable_tol</strong>: "Acceptable" convergence tolerance (relative).
<blockquote>
 Determines which (scaled) overall optimality error is considered to be "acceptable". There are two levels of termination criteria. If the usual "desired" tolerances (see tol, dual_inf_tol etc) are satisfied at an iteration, the algorithm immediately terminates with a success message. On the other hand, if the algorithm encounters "acceptable_iter" many iterations in a row that are considered "acceptable", it will terminate before the desired convergence tolerance is met. This is useful in cases where the algorithm might not be able to achieve the "desired" level of accuracy. The valid range for this real option is 0 < acceptable_tol and its default value is 10<sup>-06</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_acceptable_iter
<strong>acceptable_iter</strong>: Number of "acceptable" iterates before triggering termination.
<blockquote>
 If the algorithm encounters this many successive "acceptable" iterates (see "acceptable_tol"), it terminates, assuming that the problem has been solved to best possible accuracy given round-off. If it is set to zero, this heuristic is disabled. The valid range for this integer option is 0 &le; acceptable_iter and its default value is 15.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_acceptable_dual_inf_tol
<strong>acceptable_dual_inf_tol</strong>: "Acceptance" threshold for the dual infeasibility.
<blockquote>
 Absolute tolerance on the dual infeasibility. "Acceptable" termination requires that the (max-norm of the unscaled) dual infeasibility is less than this threshold; see also acceptable_tol. The valid range for this real option is 0 < acceptable_dual_inf_tol and its default value is 10<sup>+10</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_acceptable_constr_viol_tol
<strong>acceptable_constr_viol_tol</strong>: "Acceptance" threshold for the constraint violation.
<blockquote>
 Absolute tolerance on the constraint violation. "Acceptable" termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) constraint violation is less than this threshold; see also acceptable_tol. The valid range for this real option is 0 < acceptable_constr_viol_tol and its default value is 0.01.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_acceptable_compl_inf_tol
<strong>acceptable_compl_inf_tol</strong>: "Acceptance" threshold for the complementarity conditions.
<blockquote>
 Absolute tolerance on the complementarity. "Acceptable" termination requires that the max-norm of the (unscaled) complementarity is less than this threshold; see also acceptable_tol. The valid range for this real option is 0 < acceptable_compl_inf_tol and its default value is 0.01.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_acceptable_obj_change_tol
<strong>acceptable_obj_change_tol</strong>: "Acceptance" stopping criterion based on objective function change.
<blockquote>
 If the relative change of the objective function (scaled by Max(1,|f(x)|)) is less than this value, this part of the acceptable tolerance termination is satisfied; see also acceptable_tol. This is useful for the quasi-Newton option, which has trouble to bring down the dual infeasibility. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; acceptable_obj_change_tol and its default value is 10<sup>+20</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_diverging_iterates_tol
<strong>diverging_iterates_tol</strong>: Threshold for maximal value of primal iterates.
<blockquote>
 If any component of the primal iterates exceeded this value (in absolute terms), the optimization is aborted with the exit message that the iterates seem to be diverging. The valid range for this real option is 0 < diverging_iterates_tol and its default value is 10<sup>+20</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_mu_target
<strong>mu_target</strong>: Desired value of complementarity.
<blockquote>
 Usually, the barrier parameter is driven to zero and the termination test for complementarity is measured with respect to zero complementarity. However, in some cases it might be desired to have Ipopt solve barrier problem for strictly positive value of the barrier parameter. In this case, the value of "mu_target" specifies the final value of the barrier parameter, and the termination tests are then defined with respect to the barrier problem for this value of the barrier parameter. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; mu_target and its default value is 0.
</blockquote>


\subsection OPT_Output Output

\anchor OPT_print_level
<strong>print_level</strong>: Output verbosity level.
<blockquote>
 Sets the default verbosity level for console output. The larger this value the more detailed is the output. The valid range for this integer option is 0 &le; print_level &le; 12 and its default value is 5.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_output_file
<strong>output_file</strong>: File name of desired output file (leave unset for no file output).
<blockquote>
 NOTE: This option only works when read from the ipopt.opt options file! An output file with this name will be written (leave unset for no file output). The verbosity level is by default set to "print_level", but can be overridden with "file_print_level". The file name is changed to use only small letters. The default value for this string option is "".

Possible values:
 - *: Any acceptable standard file name
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_file_print_level
<strong>file_print_level</strong>: Verbosity level for output file.
<blockquote>
 NOTE: This option only works when read from the ipopt.opt options file! Determines the verbosity level for the file specified by "output_file". By default it is the same as "print_level". The valid range for this integer option is 0 &le; file_print_level &le; 12 and its default value is 5.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_file_append
<strong>file_append</strong>: Whether to append to output file, if set, instead of truncating.
<blockquote>
 NOTE: This option only works when read from the ipopt.opt options file! The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_print_user_options
<strong>print_user_options</strong>: Print all options set by the user.
<blockquote>
 If selected, the algorithm will print the list of all options set by the user including their values and whether they have been used. In some cases this information might be incorrect, due to the internal program flow. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_print_options_documentation
<strong>print_options_documentation</strong>: Switch to print all algorithmic options with some documentation before solving the optimization problem.
<blockquote>
 The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_print_timing_statistics
<strong>print_timing_statistics</strong>: Switch to print timing statistics.
<blockquote>
 If selected, the program will print the time spend for selected tasks. This implies timing_statistics=yes. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no

<blockquote>
 The default value for this string option is "text".

<blockquote>
 The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_print_info_string
<strong>print_info_string</strong>: Enables printing of additional info string at end of iteration output.
<blockquote>
 This string contains some insider information about the current iteration. For details, look for "Diagnostic Tags" in the Ipopt documentation. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_inf_pr_output
<strong>inf_pr_output</strong>: Determines what value is printed in the "inf_pr" output column.
<blockquote>
 Ipopt works with a reformulation of the original problem, where slacks are introduced and the problem might have been scaled. The choice "internal" prints out the constraint violation of this formulation. With "original" the true constraint violation in the original NLP is printed. The default value for this string option is "original".

Possible values:
 - internal: max-norm of violation of internal equality constraints
 - original: maximal constraint violation in original NLP
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_print_frequency_iter
<strong>print_frequency_iter</strong>: Determines at which iteration frequency the summarizing iteration output line should be printed.
<blockquote>
 Summarizing iteration output is printed every print_frequency_iter iterations, if at least print_frequency_time seconds have passed since last output. The valid range for this integer option is 1 &le; print_frequency_iter and its default value is 1.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_print_frequency_time
<strong>print_frequency_time</strong>: Determines at which time frequency the summarizing iteration output line should be printed.
<blockquote>
 Summarizing iteration output is printed if at least print_frequency_time seconds have passed since last output and the iteration number is a multiple of print_frequency_iter. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; print_frequency_time and its default value is 0.
</blockquote>


\subsection OPT_NLP NLP

\anchor OPT_nlp_lower_bound_inf
<strong>nlp_lower_bound_inf</strong>: any bound less or equal this value will be considered -inf (i.e. not lower bounded).
<blockquote>
 The valid range for this real option is unrestricted and its default value is -10<sup>+19</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_nlp_upper_bound_inf
<strong>nlp_upper_bound_inf</strong>: any bound greater or this value will be considered +inf (i.e. not upper bounded).
<blockquote>
 The valid range for this real option is unrestricted and its default value is 10<sup>+19</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_fixed_variable_treatment
<strong>fixed_variable_treatment</strong>: Determines how fixed variables should be handled.
<blockquote>
 The main difference between those options is that the starting point in the "make_constraint" case still has the fixed variables at their given values, whereas in the case "make_parameter(_nodual)" the functions are always evaluated with the fixed values for those variables.  Also, for "relax_bounds", the fixing bound constraints are relaxed (according to" bound_relax_factor"). For all but "make_parameter_nodual", bound multipliers are computed for the fixed variables. The default value for this string option is "make_parameter".

Possible values:
 - make_parameter: Remove fixed variable from optimization variables
 - make_parameter_nodual: Remove fixed variable from optimization variables and do not compute bound multipliers for fixed variables
 - make_constraint: Add equality constraints fixing variables
 - relax_bounds: Relax fixing bound constraints
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_dependency_detector
<strong>dependency_detector</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Indicates which linear solver should be used to detect linearly dependent equality constraints.
<blockquote>
 This is experimental and does not work well. The default value for this string option is "none".

Possible values:
 - none: don't check; no extra work at beginning
 - mumps: use MUMPS
 - wsmp: use WSMP
 - ma28: use MA28
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_dependency_detection_with_rhs
<strong>dependency_detection_with_rhs</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Indicates if the right hand sides of the constraints should be considered in addition to gradients during dependency detection
<blockquote>
 The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_num_linear_variables
<strong>num_linear_variables</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Number of linear variables
<blockquote>
 When the Hessian is approximated, it is assumed that the first num_linear_variables variables are linear. The Hessian is then not approximated in this space. If the get_number_of_nonlinear_variables method in the TNLP is implemented, this option is ignored. The valid range for this integer option is 0 &le; num_linear_variables and its default value is 0.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_jacobian_approximation
<strong>jacobian_approximation</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Specifies technique to compute constraint Jacobian
<blockquote>
 The default value for this string option is "exact".

Possible values:
 - exact: user-provided derivatives
 - finite-difference-values: user-provided structure, values by finite differences
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_gradient_approximation
<strong>gradient_approximation</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Specifies technique to compute objective Gradient
<blockquote>
 The default value for this string option is "exact".

Possible values:
 - exact: user-provided gradient
 - finite-difference-values: values by finite differences
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_findiff_perturbation
<strong>findiff_perturbation</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Size of the finite difference perturbation for derivative approximation.
<blockquote>
 This determines the relative perturbation of the variable entries. The valid range for this real option is 0 < findiff_perturbation and its default value is 10<sup>-07</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_kappa_d
<strong>kappa_d</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Weight for linear damping term (to handle one-sided bounds).
<blockquote>
 See Section 3.7 in implementation paper. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; kappa_d and its default value is 10<sup>-05</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_bound_relax_factor
<strong>bound_relax_factor</strong>: Factor for initial relaxation of the bounds.
<blockquote>
 Before start of the optimization, the bounds given by the user are relaxed. This option sets the factor for this relaxation. Additional, the constraint violation tolerance constr_viol_tol is used to bound the relaxation by an absolute value. If it is set to zero, then then bounds relaxation is disabled. See Eqn.(35) in implementation paper. Note that the constraint violation reported by Ipopt at the end of the solution process does not include violations of the original (non-relaxed) variable bounds. See also option honor_original_bounds. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; bound_relax_factor and its default value is 10<sup>-08</sup>.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_honor_original_bounds
<strong>honor_original_bounds</strong>: Indicates whether final points should be projected into original bounds.
<blockquote>
 Ipopt might relax the bounds during the optimization (see, e.g., option "bound_relax_factor"). This option determines whether the final point should be projected back into the user-provide original bounds after the optimization. Note that violations of constraints and complementarity reported by Ipopt at the end of the solution process are for the non-projected point. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_check_derivatives_for_naninf
<strong>check_derivatives_for_naninf</strong>: Indicates whether it is desired to check for Nan/Inf in derivative matrices
<blockquote>
 Activating this option will cause an error if an invalid number is detected in the constraint Jacobians or the Lagrangian Hessian. If this is not activated, the test is skipped, and the algorithm might proceed with invalid numbers and fail. If test is activated and an invalid number is detected, the matrix is written to output with print_level corresponding to J_MOREDETAILED (7); so beware of large output! The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_grad_f_constant
<strong>grad_f_constant</strong>: Indicates whether to assume that the objective function is linear
<blockquote>
 Activating this option will cause Ipopt to ask for the Gradient of the objective function only once from the NLP and reuse this information later. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_jac_c_constant
<strong>jac_c_constant</strong>: Indicates whether to assume that all equality constraints are linear
<blockquote>
 Activating this option will cause Ipopt to ask for the Jacobian of the equality constraints only once from the NLP and reuse this information later. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_jac_d_constant
<strong>jac_d_constant</strong>: Indicates whether to assume that all inequality constraints are linear
<blockquote>
 Activating this option will cause Ipopt to ask for the Jacobian of the inequality constraints only once from the NLP and reuse this information later. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_hessian_constant
<strong>hessian_constant</strong>: Indicates whether to assume the problem is a QP (quadratic objective, linear constraints)
<blockquote>
 Activating this option will cause Ipopt to ask for the Hessian of the Lagrangian function only once from the NLP and reuse this information later. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>


\subsection OPT_NLP_Scaling NLP Scaling

\anchor OPT_nlp_scaling_method
<strong>nlp_scaling_method</strong>: Select the technique used for scaling the NLP.
<blockquote>
 Selects the technique used for scaling the problem internally before it is solved. For user-scaling, the parameters come from the NLP. If you are using AMPL, they can be specified through suffixes ("scaling_factor") The default value for this string option is "gradient-based".

Possible values:
 - none: no problem scaling will be performed
 - user-scaling: scaling parameters will come from the user
 - gradient-based: scale the problem so the maximum gradient at the starting point is nlp_scaling_max_gradient
 - equilibration-based: scale the problem so that first derivatives are of order 1 at random points (uses Harwell routine MC19)
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_obj_scaling_factor
<strong>obj_scaling_factor</strong>: Scaling factor for the objective function.
<blockquote>
 This option sets a scaling factor for the objective function. The scaling is seen internally by Ipopt but the unscaled objective is reported in the console output. If additional scaling parameters are computed (e.g. user-scaling or gradient-based), both factors are multiplied. If this value is chosen to be negative, Ipopt will maximize the objective function instead of minimizing it. The valid range for this real option is unrestricted and its default value is 1.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_nlp_scaling_max_gradient
<strong>nlp_scaling_max_gradient</strong>: Maximum gradient after NLP scaling.
<blockquote>
 This is the gradient scaling cut-off. If the maximum gradient is above this value, then gradient based scaling will be performed. Scaling parameters are calculated to scale the maximum gradient back to this value. (This is g_max in Section 3.8 of the implementation paper.) Note: This option is only used if "nlp_scaling_method" is chosen as "gradient-based". The valid range for this real option is 0 < nlp_scaling_max_gradient and its default value is 100.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_nlp_scaling_obj_target_gradient
<strong>nlp_scaling_obj_target_gradient</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Target value for objective function gradient size.
<blockquote>
 If a positive number is chosen, the scaling factor for the objective function is computed so that the gradient has the max norm of the given size at the starting point. This overrides nlp_scaling_max_gradient for the objective function. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; nlp_scaling_obj_target_gradient and its default value is 0.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_nlp_scaling_constr_target_gradient
<strong>nlp_scaling_constr_target_gradient</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Target value for constraint function gradient size.
<blockquote>
 If a positive number is chosen, the scaling factors for the constraint functions are computed so that the gradient has the max norm of the given size at the starting point. This overrides nlp_scaling_max_gradient for the constraint functions. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; nlp_scaling_constr_target_gradient and its default value is 0.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_nlp_scaling_min_value
<strong>nlp_scaling_min_value</strong>: Minimum value of gradient-based scaling values.
<blockquote>
 This is the lower bound for the scaling factors computed by gradient-based scaling method. If some derivatives of some functions are huge, the scaling factors will otherwise become very small, and the (unscaled) final constraint violation, for example, might then be significant. Note: This option is only used if "nlp_scaling_method" is chosen as "gradient-based". The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; nlp_scaling_min_value and its default value is 10<sup>-08</sup>.
</blockquote>


\subsection OPT_Initialization Initialization

\anchor OPT_bound_push
<strong>bound_push</strong>: Desired minimum absolute distance from the initial point to bound.
<blockquote>
 Determines how much the initial point might have to be modified in order to be sufficiently inside the bounds (together with "bound_frac"). (This is kappa_1 in Section 3.6 of implementation paper.) The valid range for this real option is 0 < bound_push and its default value is 0.01.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_bound_frac
<strong>bound_frac</strong>: Desired minimum relative distance from the initial point to bound.
<blockquote>
 Determines how much the initial point might have to be modified in order to be sufficiently inside the bounds (together with "bound_push"). (This is kappa_2 in Section 3.6 of implementation paper.) The valid range for this real option is 0 < bound_frac &le; 0.5 and its default value is 0.01.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_slack_bound_push
<strong>slack_bound_push</strong>: Desired minimum absolute distance from the initial slack to bound.
<blockquote>
 Determines how much the initial slack variables might have to be modified in order to be sufficiently inside the inequality bounds (together with "slack_bound_frac"). (This is kappa_1 in Section 3.6 of implementation paper.) The valid range for this real option is 0 < slack_bound_push and its default value is 0.01.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_slack_bound_frac
<strong>slack_bound_frac</strong>: Desired minimum relative distance from the initial slack to bound.
<blockquote>
 Determines how much the initial slack variables might have to be modified in order to be sufficiently inside the inequality bounds (together with "slack_bound_push"). (This is kappa_2 in Section 3.6 of implementation paper.) The valid range for this real option is 0 < slack_bound_frac &le; 0.5 and its default value is 0.01.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_constr_mult_init_max
<strong>constr_mult_init_max</strong>: Maximum allowed least-square guess of constraint multipliers.
<blockquote>
 Determines how large the initial least-square guesses of the constraint multipliers are allowed to be (in max-norm). If the guess is larger than this value, it is discarded and all constraint multipliers are set to zero. This options is also used when initializing the restoration phase. By default, "resto.constr_mult_init_max" (the one used in RestoIterateInitializer) is set to zero. The valid range for this real option is 0 &le; constr_mult_init_max and its default value is 1000.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_bound_mult_init_val
<strong>bound_mult_init_val</strong>: Initial value for the bound multipliers.
<blockquote>
 All dual variables corresponding to bound constraints are initialized to this value. The valid range for this real option is 0 < bound_mult_init_val and its default value is 1.
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_bound_mult_init_method
<strong>bound_mult_init_method</strong>: Initialization method for bound multipliers
<blockquote>
 This option defines how the iterates for the bound multipliers are initialized. If "constant" is chosen, then all bound multipliers are initialized to the value of "bound_mult_init_val". If "mu-based" is chosen, then each value is initialized to the the value of "mu_init" divided by the corresponding slack variable. This latter option might be useful if the starting point is close to the optimal solution. The default value for this string option is "constant".

Possible values:
 - constant: set all bound multipliers to the value of bound_mult_init_val
 - mu-based: initialize to mu_init/x_slack
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_least_square_init_primal
<strong>least_square_init_primal</strong>: Least square initialization of the primal variables
<blockquote>
 If set to yes, Ipopt ignores the user provided point and solves a least square problem for the primal variables (x and s) to fit the linearized equality and inequality constraints.This might be useful if the user doesn't know anything about the starting point, or for solving an LP or QP. The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values:
 - no: take user-provided point
 - yes: overwrite user-provided point with least-square estimates
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_least_square_init_duals
<strong>least_square_init_duals</strong>: Least square initialization of all dual variables
<blockquote>
 If set to yes, Ipopt tries to compute least-square multipliers (considering ALL dual variables). If successful, the bound multipliers are possibly corrected to be at least bound_mult_init_val. This might be useful if the user doesn't know anything about the starting point, or for solving an LP or QP. This overwrites option "bound_mult_init_method". The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values:
 - no: use bound_mult_init_val and least-square equality constraint multipliers
 - yes: overwrite user-provided point with least-square estimates
</blockquote>


\subsection OPT_Warm_Start Warm Start

\anchor OPT_warm_start_init_point
<strong>warm_start_init_point</strong>: Warm-start for initial point
<blockquote>
 Indicates whether this optimization should use a warm start initialization, where values of primal and dual variables are given (e.g., from a previous optimization of a related problem.) The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values:
 - no: do not use the warm start initialization
 - yes: use the warm start initialization
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_warm_start_same_structure
<strong>warm_start_same_structure</strong> (<em>advanced</em>): Indicates whether a problem with a structure identical to the previous one is to be solved.
<blockquote>
 If enabled, then the algorithm assumes that an NLP is now to be solved whose structure is identical to one that already was considered (with the same NLP object). The default value for this string option is "no".

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

Possible values: yes, no
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_fast_step_computation
<strong>fast_step_computation</strong>: Indicates if the linear system should be solved quickly.

</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_neg_curv_test_tol
<strong>neg_curv_test_tol</strong>: Tolerance for heuristic to ignore wrong inertia.

 - no: use original IPOPT approach, in which the primal regularization is ignored
</blockquote>

\anchor OPT_max_hessian_perturbation
<strong>max_hessian_perturbation</strong>: Maximum value of regularization parameter for handling negative curvature.
<blockquote>
 In order to guarantee that the search directions are indeed proper descent directions, Ipopt requires that the inertia of the (augmented) linear system for the step computation has the correct number of negative and positive eigenvalues. The idea is that this guides the algorithm away from maximizers and makes Ipopt more likely converge to first order optimal points that are minimizers. If the inertia is not correct, a multiple of the identity matrix is added to the Hessian of the Lagrangian in the augmented system. This parameter gives the maximum value of the regularization parameter. If a regularization of that size is not enough, the algorithm skips this iteration and goes to the restoration phase. This is delta_w^max in the implementation paper. The valid range for this real option is 0 < max_hessian_perturbation and its default value is 10<sup>+20</sup>.

<strong>expect_infeasible_problem</strong>: Enable heuristics to quickly detect an infeasible problem.
<blockquote>
 This options is meant to activate heuristics that may speed up the infeasibility determination if you expect that there is a good chance for the problem to be infeasible. In the filter line search procedure, the restoration phase is called more quickly than usually, and more reduction in the constraint violation is enforced before the restoration phase is left. If the problem is square, this option is enabled automatically. The default value for this string option is "no".

<strong>evaluate_orig_obj_at_resto_trial</strong>: Determines if the original objective function should be evaluated at restoration phase trial points.
<blockquote>
 Enabling this option makes the restoration phase algorithm evaluate the objective function of the original problem at every trial point encountered during the restoration phase, even if this value is not required.  In this way, it is guaranteed that the original objective function can be evaluated without error at all accepted iterates; otherwise the algorithm might fail at a point where the restoration phase accepts an iterate that is good for the restoration phase problem, but not the original problem. On the other hand, if the evaluation of the original objective is expensive, this might be costly. The default value for this string option is "yes".
