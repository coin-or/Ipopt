\page INSTALL Installing %Ipopt

\tableofcontents

The following sections describe the installation procedures on
UNIX/Linux, macOS, and Windows systems.

The configuration script and Makefiles in the %Ipopt
distribution have been created using GNU's autoconf and automake.
In general, you can see the list of options and variables that can be
set for the configure script by typing `configure --help`.
<!-- TODO Also, the
[generic COIN-OR help pages](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp)
are a valuable resource of information. -->


\section SYSTEMPACKAGES Getting System Packages (Compilers, ...)

\subsection SYSTEMPACKAGES_LINUX Linux distributions

Many Linux distributions will come with all necessary tools. All you
should need to do is check the compiler versions. On a Debian-based
distribution, you can obtain all necessary tools with the following
command:

    sudo apt-get install gcc g++ gfortran git patch wget pkg-config liblapack-dev libmetis-dev

Replace apt-get with your relevant package manager, e.g. `dnf` for
RedHat-based distributions, `pacman` for Arch, etc. The g++ and gfortran
compilers may need to be specified respectively as `gcc-c++` and
`gcc-gfortran` with some package managers.

If \ref INT64_BUILD, a variant of Lapack that uses 64-bit integers is required.
On some Linux distributions (e.g., Ubuntu), this is available by installing package `liblapack64-dev`.

\subsection SYSTEMPACKAGES_MAC macOS

You need either the [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads)
or a community alternative such as Homebrew to install the GNU compilers:

    brew update
    brew install bash gcc
    brew link --overwrite gcc

Further, pkg-config is required, which can be installed via Homebrew by

    brew install pkg-config

If you have Xcode installed, the Command Line Tools are available under
Preferences, Downloads. These items unfortunately do not come with a Fortran
compiler, but you can get gfortran from
http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS.
In the past, we have been able to compile %Ipopt using default Xcode
versions of gcc and g++ and a newer version of gfortran from this link,
but consistent version numbers may be an issue in future cases.

If you intend to use \ref DOWNLOAD_MUMPS "MUMPS" or one of the \ref DOWNLOAD_HSL "HSL linear solvers",
then they may profit from an installation of METIS.
This can be accomplished via

    brew install metis

\subsection SYSTEMPACKAGES_MSYS Windows with MSYS2/MinGW

For Windows, one can compile %Ipopt under MSYS2/MinGW, which is a
light-weight UNIX-like environment for Windows.

MSYS2/MinGW can be obtained from <https://www.msys2.org/>.
After installation, a number of additional packages need to be installed:

    pacman -S binutils diffutils git grep make patch pkg-config

(I might have forgotten something.)
If you also want to use GNU compilers, then install them, too:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran

When using MinGW, it is convenient to install MinGW's Lapack and METIS as well:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-lapack mingw-w64-x86_64-metis

To use MSYS2/MinGW to compile %Ipopt with native MSVC/Intel compilers,
the basic version MSYS2 version without MinGW is sufficient.
To use the GNU compilers, MinGW is required.

If you want to use the native MSVC or Intel compiler, you need to make sure
that environment variables are setup for the compilers.
One way is to create a shell script that executes the batch files that
are provided by Microsoft and Intel for this purpose before starting MSYS2.
For using MSVC, this script may have a form similar to

    set MSYS2_PATH_TYPE=inherit
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
    C:\msys64\msys2.exe
    exit 0

For using Intel C/C++ and Fortran compilers, the 2nd line may be replaced
by something like

    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\IntelSWTools\compilers_and_libraries\windows\bin\ipsxe-comp-vars.bat" intel64 vs2017

You might have to search around a bit. The important thing is that,
after your change, you can type `cl` and it finds the Microsoft C++ compiler
and, if installed, you can type `ifort` and it finds the Intel Fortran compiler.

\note The build systems of %Ipopt by default first looks for GCC and Clang
before the Intel and MS compilers. To disable this, specify the flag
`--enable-msvc` as argument to configure below.

\section EXTERNALCODE Download, build, and install dependencies

%Ipopt uses a few external packages that are not included
in the %Ipopt source code distribution, for example ASL (the
AMPL Solver Library if you want to compile the %Ipopt AMPL
solver executable), Blas, Lapack.

%Ipopt also requires at least one linear solver for sparse
symmetric indefinite matrices. There are different possibilities, see
below. **It is important to keep in mind that usually
the largest fraction of computation time in the optimizer is spent for
solving the linear system, and that your choice of the linear solver
impacts %Ipopt's speed and robustness. It might be
worthwhile to try different linear solver to experiment with what is
best for your application.**

Since this third party software is released under different licenses
than %Ipopt, we cannot distribute their code together with
the %Ipopt packages and have to ask you to go through the
hassle of obtaining it yourself. Keep in mind that it is still your responsibility
to ensure that your downloading and usage of the third party components
conforms with their licenses.

For ASL, HSL, and MUMPS, COIN-OR provides specialized build systems
that produce libraries which are easy to use with the build system of %Ipopt.
Some of the specialized build systems also come with a script that makes it
easy to download the code using `wget` or `curl`.

\subsection EXTERNALCODE_ASL ASL (Ampl Solver Library)

Note that you only need to obtain the ASL if you intend to use
%Ipopt from AMPL. It is not required if you want to specify
your optimization problem in a programming language (e.g., C++, C, or
Fortran).

The COIN-OR Tools project [ThirdParty-ASL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-ASL/)
can be used to download the ASL code and build an ASL library that is
recognized by Ipopt.
To do so, execute

    git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-ASL.git
    cd ThirdParty-ASL
    ./get.ASL
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

\subsection EXTERNALCODE_LINALG BLAS and LAPACK

%Ipopt's build system tries to find an installation of BLAS and LAPACK
in your system.
On Ubuntu, such libraries can be made available by installing liblapack-dev.
Other Linux distributions typically also offer a way to install Blas and
Lapack via its package manager.
On macOS, %Ipopt's build system should pick up the Blas and Lapack
from the Accelerate framework.

\note It is **highly recommended that you obtain an efficient
implementation of the BLAS and LAPACK library**, tailored to your hardware;
Section \ref PREREQUISITES lists a few options.
For instance, to have configure pick up a local installation of
[ATLAS](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net) in $HOME/lib, one would use
the `--with-lapack-lflags` flag when running `configure` (see \ref COMPILEINSTALL):
\verbatim
./configure --with-lapack-lflags="-L$HOME/lib -lf77blas -lcblas -latlas"
\endverbatim
The configure script already tries to find Intel MKL libraries on some
systems. If that fails, e.g., because the libraries are not available
in a standard search path, then also use the `--with-lapack-lflags` flag to
explictly state what flags are necessary to use MKL, e.g.,
\verbatim
./configure --with-lapack-lflags="-L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -Wl,--no-as-needed -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lm"
\endverbatim

\subsection DOWNLOAD_HSL HSL (Harwell Subroutines Library)

There are two versions of HSL available:

- HSL Archive:   contains outdated codes that are freely available for personal
    commercial or non-commercial usage. Note that you may not
    redistribute these codes in either source or binary form without
    purchasing a licence from the authors. This version includes MA27,
    MA28, and MC19.

- HSL Full:   contains more modern codes that are freely available for academic
    use only. This version includes the codes from the HSL Archive and
    additionally MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, and HSL_MA97.
    %Ipopt supports the HSL Full codes from 2013 and later.

To obtain the HSL code, you can follow the following steps:

1.  Go to <http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt>.

2.  Choose whether to download either the Archive code or the HSL Full
    code. To download, select the relevant "source" link.

3.  Follow the instructions on the website, read the license, and submit
    the registration form.

4.  Wait for an email containing a download link (this should take no
    more than one working day).

You may either:

-   Compile the HSL code via the COIN-OR Tools project
    [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL).
    See the instructions below.

-   Compile the HSL code separately either before or after the
    %Ipopt code and use the shared library loading
    mechanism. See the documentation distributed with the HSL package
    for information on how to do so.

To compile the HSL code via the COIN-OR Tools project
[ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL), run

    git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL.git
    cd ThirdParty-HSL

Now unpack the HSL sources archive, move and rename the resulting directory
so that it becomes `ThirdParty-HSL/coinhsl`.
Then, in `ThirdParty-HSL`, configure, build, and install the HSL sources:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

\attention The build system of Ipopt currently requires that MA27 is part
of a HSL library, if a HSL library is provided.

\note Whereas it is essential to have at least one linear solver, the
package MC19 could be omitted (with the consequence that you cannot use
this method for scaling the linear systems arising inside the
%Ipopt algorithm). By default, MC19 is only used to scale
the linear system when using one of the HSL solvers, but it can also be
switched on for other linear solvers (which usually have internal
scaling mechanisms). Further, also the package MA28 can be omitted,
since it is used only in the experimental dependency detector, which is
not used by default.

\note If you are an academic or a student, we recommend you download the
HSL Full package as this ensures you have access to the full range of
solvers. MA57 can be considerably faster than MA27 on some problems.

\note If you have a precompiled library containing the HSL
codes, you can specify the directory containing the `CoinHslConfig.h`
header file and the linker flags for this library with the
flags `--with-hsl-cflags` and `--with-hsl-lflags` flags, respectively,
when running `configure` of %Ipopt  (see \ref COMPILEINSTALL).

\note The linear solvers MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, HSL_MA97 can
make use of the matrix ordering algorithms implemented in
[METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview).
ThirdParty-HSL will look automatically for a METIS installation in your
system and should work with both METIS 4 and METIS 5.

\subsubsection LINEARSOLVERLOADER Providing a HSL library at runtime

Alternatively to linking against HSL routines when %Ipopt is build,
%Ipopt can also load a shared library with MA27, MA57, HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86,
HSL_MA97, or MC19 at runtime.
This means, if you obtain one of those solvers
after you compiled %Ipopt, you don't need to recompile Ipopt to
use it. Instead, you can just place a shared library onto your system and
ensure that %Ipopt can find it at runtime.
Option \ref OPT_hsllib "hsllib" can be set to the name of the library from
which to load HSL routines if a HSL solver is selected. The name can contain
a path; otherwise, the shared library search path (e.g., `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`)
will be used.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_MUMPS MUMPS Linear Solver

You can also use the (public domain) sparse linear solver MUMPS. Please
visit the [MUMPS home page](http://mumps.enseeiht.fr/) for more
information about the solver. MUMPS is provided as Fortran 90 and C
source code. You need to have a Fortran 90 compiler (e.g., the
GNU compiler gfortran) to be able to use it.

The COIN-OR Tools project [ThirdParty-Mumps](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-Mumps)
can be used to download the MUMPS code and build a MUMPS library
that is recognized by %Ipopt.
To do so, execute

    git clone https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-Mumps.git
    cd ThirdParty-Mumps
    ./get.Mumps
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

\note MUMPS will perform better if the matrix ordering algorithms implemented
in [METIS](http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview) are
available on the system.

\note The non-MPI version of MUMPS uses internally a fake implementation
of MPI, which can prevent using %Ipopt together with MUMPS within an MPI program.
You will have to either modify the MUMPS sources so that the MPI symbols
inside the MUMPS code are renamed or use a MPI-parallel version of MUMPS.
In the latter case and if a GCC compatible compiler is used, the %Ipopt
library will call `MPI_Init()` and `MPI_Finalize()` when loaded and unloaded,
respectively. To prevent this, use the configure flag `--disable-mpiinit`.
Note that the %Ipopt executable, tests, and examples will not work in this
case (if using MUMPS as linear solver).

\note Branch `stable/2.1` of project ThirdParty-Mumps can be used to build
a library of MUMPS 4 that is usable with %Ipopt. Initial experiments on
the CUTEst testset have shown that performance with MUMPS 5.2.x is worse
than with MUMPS 4.10.0 on average, but note that MUMPS 4 is not longer
maintained.

To compile %Ipopt with a precompiled MUMPS library, you need to specify
the `-I` flag to have the compiler find the directory containing the
MUMPS header files with the `--with-mumps-cflags` flag of %Ipopt's configure,
e.g.,
\verbatim
--with-mumps-cflags="-I$HOME/MUMPS/include"
\endverbatim
and you also need to provide the linker flags for MUMPS with the
`--with-mumps-lflags` flag.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_PARDISO Pardiso (Parallel Sparse Direct Linear Solver) from Pardiso Project

If you would like to use %Ipopt with Pardiso from Pardiso Project,
you need to obtain the Pardiso library from <http://www.pardiso-project.org>
for your operating system.

From <http://www.pardiso-project.org>, you can obtain a limited time
license of Pardiso for academic or evaluation purposes or buy a
non-profit or commercial license. Make sure you read the license
agreement before filling out the download form.

To avoid conflicts with \ref DOWNLOAD_PARDISOMKL, %Ipopt only offers the
option to load Pardiso from Pardiso Project at runtime.
Therefore, the %Ipopt interface to Pardiso from Pardiso Project is always
build and the value of option \ref OPT_pardisolib "pardisolib" is used as
name (possibly including a path) for the library to be loaded.
The configure option `--with-pardiso` can be used to specify the default
value for option `pardisolib`. Further, if `--with-pardiso` is specified
and HSL codes are not available at compile time, then the default of option
\ref OPT_linear_solver "linear_solver" is set to `pardiso`.
For example, if you want that %Ipopt loads the GCC version of Pardiso
on a GNU/Linux system and this library is located in `$HOME/lib`, you
should add the flag
\verbatim
--with-pardiso="$HOME/lib/libpardiso720-GNU831-X86-64.so"
\endverbatim

\attention With %Ipopt <= 3.13, Pardiso from Pardiso Project was linked
when %Ipopt was build and option `--with-pardiso` used to specify the
corresponding linker flags. This has been changed with %Ipopt 3.14!

If you are using the parallel version of Pardiso, you need to
specify the number of processors it should run on with the
environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, as described in the Pardiso
manual.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_PARDISOMKL Pardiso from Intel MKL

If you want to compile %Ipopt with the Pardiso library
that is included in Intel MKL, it is sufficient to ensure
that MKL is used for the linear algebra routines (Blas/Lapack),
see \ref EXTERNALCODE_LINALG.

If configure finds that Pardiso is available with Lapack, option
\ref OPT_linear_solver "linear_solver" can be set to `pardisomkl` to use
Pardiso from Intel MKL.
Specifying `--disable-pardisomkl` as option for configure disables the
check for Pardiso from Intel MKL.

\attention With %Ipopt <= 3.13, Pardiso from Intel MKL could be selected
by setting \ref OPT_linear_solver "linear_solver" to `pardiso`. With
%Ipopt 3.14, value `pardiso` is reserved for Pardiso from Pardiso Project
and value `pardisomkl` has to be used to select Pardiso from Intel MKL.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_SPRAL SPRAL (Sparse Parallel Robust Algorithms Library)

To compile %Ipopt with the linear solver SPRAL,
[SPRAL](https://github.com/ralna/spral) should first
be downloaded and compiled according to the associated
[SPRAL compilation guide](https://github.com/ralna/spral/blob/master/COMPILE.md).
Alternatively, consider using the [LANL ANSI fork of SPRAL](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/spral).
The maintainer of this fork test whether their current version works with %Ipopt.

After compilation of SPRAL, while configuring %Ipopt,
you need to specify the link and include directories for the library with the
`--with-spral-lflags` and `--with-spral-cflags` flags, including required
additional libraries and flags. For example, if you want to compile %Ipopt with
a purely CPU-parallel version of SPRAL (libs in `/path/to/spral/lib` and headers
in `/path/to/spral/include`) on a GNU/Linux system, you should add the
following flags to the `configure` command:
\verbatim
--with-spral-lflags="-L/path/to/spral/lib -lspral -lgfortran -lhwloc -lm -lcoinmetis -lopenblas -lstdc++ -fopenmp"
--with-spral-cflags="-I/path/to/spral/include"
\endverbatim
For a CPU and graphics processing unit- (GPU-) parallel version of SPRAL,
the following flags should be used, instead:
\verbatim
--with-spral-lflags="-L/path/to/spral/lib -lspral -lgfortran -lhwloc -lm -lcoinmetis -lopenblas -lstdc++ -fopenmp -lcudadevrt -lcudart -lcuda -lcublas"
--with-spral-cflags="-I/path/to/spral/include"
\endverbatim
The above assume a SPRAL compilation using OpenBLAS libraries. For best
performance, use SPRAL together with linear algebra routines from the Intel MKL
(see \ref EXTERNALCODE_LINALG).

\attention
Finally, ensure the following environment variables are employed when using SPRAL:
\verbatim
export OMP_CANCELLATION=TRUE
export OMP_NESTED=TRUE
export OMP_PROC_BIND=TRUE
\endverbatim

A guide for building %Ipopt with Spral on Ubuntu Linux is also avaiable
[here](https://gist.github.com/tasseff/ee61ef6c15d3c54e0a6b3e488f2a65be)
(some GitHub URLs need to be adjusted to use coin-or/Ipopt instead of lanl-ansi/Ipopt).
More information on the Spral interface of %Ipopt can be found in \cite Tasseff2019.

\subsection DOWNLOAD_WSMP WSMP (Watson Sparse Matrix Package)

If you would like to compile %Ipopt with WSMP, you need to obtain the
WSMP library for your operating system. Information about WSMP can be
found at <http://www.research.ibm.com/projects/wsmp>.

At this website you can download the library for several operating
systems including a trial license key for 90 days that allows you to use
WSMP for "educational, research, and benchmarking purposes by non-profit
academic institutions" or evaluation purposes by commercial
organizations; make sure you read the license agreement before using the
library. Once you obtained the library and license, please check if the
version number of the library matches the one on the WSMP website.

\note The license included in package of the libraries may not work and a
  working one may need to be downloaded separately. Look out for messages
  about an invalid WSMP license when testing the Ipopt build.

If a newer version is announced on that website, you can (and probably
should) request the current version by sending a message to
`wsmp@us.ibm.com`. Please include the operating system and other
details to describe which particular version of WSMP you need.

\note Only the interface to the shared-memory version of WSMP is
currently supported.

To compile %Ipopt with the linear solver WSMP, you need to specify the
linker flags for the library with the `--with-wsmp` flag, including
required additional libraries and flags. For example, if you want to compile
%Ipopt with WSMP (located in `$HOME/lib`) on an Intel IA32 Linux system,
you may use the `configure` flag
\verbatim
--with-wsmp="$HOME/lib/wsmp/wsmp-Linux/lib/IA32/libwsmp.a -lpthread -lblas -llapack -lpthread -lm -lgfortran"
\endverbatim
But the actual flags depend on WSMP library and your preference for the Blas/Lapack libraries.


\section GETIPOPT Getting the Ipopt Code

%Ipopt is available from the COIN-OR group at GitHub. You can either
download the code using `git` or
simply retrieve a tarball (compressed archive file). While the tarball
is an easy method to retrieve the code, using the *git*
system allows users the benefits of the version control system,
including easy updates and revision control.

\subsection GETIPOPT_GIT Getting the Ipopt code via git

Of course, the *git* client must be installed on your system if you want
to obtain the code this way (the executable is called `git`).
Information about *git* and how to download it can be found at
<http://git-scm.com>.

To obtain the %Ipopt source code via git, change into the
directory in which you want to create a subdirectory `%Ipopt` with the
%Ipopt source code. Then follow the steps below:

1.  Download the code from the repository:
    \verbatim
git clone https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt.git
    \endverbatim

2.  Change into the root directory of the %Ipopt distribution: \verbatim
cd Ipopt
    \endverbatim

In the following, `$IPOPTDIR` will refer to the directory in which you
are right now (output of `pwd`).

\subsection GETIPOPT_TAR Getting the Ipopt code as a tarball

To use the tarball, follow the steps below:

1.  Download the desired tarball from
    <https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/releases>, it has the form
    `Ipopt-x.y.z.tgz`, where `x.y.z` is the version number, such as
    3.12.0.

2.  Issue the following commands to unpack the archive file:
    \verbatim
gunzip Ipopt-x.y.z.tgz
tar xvf Ipopt-x.y.z.tar
    \endverbatim

3.  Rename the directory you just extracted: \verbatim
mv Ipopt-x.y.z Ipopt
    \endverbatim

4.  Change into the root directory of the %Ipopt distribution: \verbatim
cd Ipopt
    \endverbatim

In the following, `$IPOPTDIR` will refer to the directory in which you
are right now (output of `pwd`).

\section COMPILEINSTALL Compiling and Installing Ipopt

%Ipopt can be easily compiled and installed with the usual
configure, make, make install commands. We follow the procedure that is
used for most of the COIN-OR projects, based on the GNU autotools.
<!--TODO reactivate when updated wiki:
At <https://github.com/coin-or-tools/BuildTools/wiki> you can find a general
description of the tools. -->

Below are the basic steps for the %Ipopt compilation that
should work on most systems. For special compilations and for some
troubleshooting see \ref CONFIGURE_FLAGS
<!--TODO reactivate when updated wiki:
and consult the [generic COIN-OR help page](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/BuildTools/wiki)
--> before creating an issue or sending a message to the mailing list.

1.  Create a directory where you want to compile %Ipopt, for example
    \verbatim
mkdir $IPOPTDIR/build
    \endverbatim
    and change into this directory
    \verbatim
cd $IPOPTDIR/build
    \endverbatim

    \note You can choose any location, including $IPOPTDIR itself, as
    the location of your compilation. However, on COIN-OR we recommend
    to keep the source and compiled files separate as this comes in handy
    when you want to compile the code with different compilers, compiler
    options, or different operating system that share a common file system.
    For this to work, the directories with the %Ipopt source must not have
    any configuration and compiled code.

2.  Run the configure script:
    \verbatim
$IPOPTDIR/configure
    \endverbatim

    One might have to give options to the configure script, e.g., in
    order to choose a non-default compiler, or to tell it where to install
    %Ipopt eventually, see \ref CONFIGURE_FLAGS.

    If the last output line reads
    `configure: Main configuration of %Ipopt successful` then
    everything worked fine. Otherwise, look at the screen output, have a
    look at the `config.log` output file and/or consult \ref CONFIGURE_FLAGS.

    The default configure (without any options) is sufficient for most
    users that downloaded and installed the source code for the linear solver
    and other dependencies. If you want to see the configure options,
    consult \ref CONFIGURE_FLAGS.
    <!-- TODO and also visit the generic
    [COIN-OR configuration instruction page](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure).-->

3.  Build the code:
    \verbatim
make
    \endverbatim

    Note: If you are using GNU make, you can also try to speed up the
    compilation by using the `-jN` flag (e.g., `make -j3`), where `N` is the
    number of parallel compilation jobs. A good number for `N` is the
    number of available processors plus one. Under some circumstances,
    this fails, and you might have to re-issue the command, or omit the
    `-j` flag.

4.  If you want, you can run a short test to verify that the compilation
    was successful. For this, you just enter
    \verbatim
make test
    \endverbatim
    This will test if the AMPL solver executable works (if you got the
    ASL code) and if the included C++, C, Java, and Fortran examples work.

    \note The configure script is not able to automatically determine
    the C++ runtime libraries for the C++ compiler. For certain
    compilers we enabled default values for this, but those might not
    exist or be wrong for your compiler. In that case, the C and Fortran
    example in the test will most probably fail to compile. If you don't
    want to hook up the compiled %Ipopt library to some
    Fortran or C code that you wrote you don't need to worry about this.
    If you do want to link the %Ipopt library with a C or
    Fortran compiler, you need to find out the C++ runtime libraries
    (e.g., by running the C++ compiler in verbose mode for a simple
    example program) and run `configure` again, and this time specify all
    C++ runtime libraries with the `CXXLIBS` variable (see also
    \ref CONFIGURE_FLAGS).

5.  Install %Ipopt:
    \verbatim
sudo make install
    \endverbatim
    `sudo` has been added here as `make install` installs files into
    `/usr/local`, where only system administrators have write permissions.
    This installs

    -   the %Ipopt and `sIpopt` AMPL solver executables (if ASL source
        was downloaded) in `/usr/local/bin`,

    -   the %Ipopt and `sIpopt` libraries (`libipopt.so`, `libipopt.a` or
        similar) in `/usr/local/lib`,

    -   pkg-config files for use of the %Ipopt and `sIpopt` libraries
        (`ipopt.pc`, `sipopt.pc`) in `/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig`.

    -   %Ipopt and `sIpopt` header files `/usr/local/include/coin-or`,

    -   the \ref INTERFACE_JAVA "Java Interface" jar file in `/usr/local/share/java`.

    You can change the default installation directory (here `/usr/local`)
    by using the `--prefix` switch for `configure`. If this is a directory
    that you have write permissions for, `sudo` can be omitted for `make install`.

\subsection CONFIGURE_FLAGS Flags to configure

In general, you can see the list of options and variables that can be
set for the configure script by typing `configure --help`.
<!-- TODO Also, the
[generic COIN-OR help pages](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp)
are a valuable resource of information. -->

Below a few particular options are discussed:

-   If you want to specify that you want to use particular compilers,
    you can do so by adding the variables definitions for CXX, CC, and
    F77 to the `./configure` command line, to specify the C++, C, and
    Fortran 77 compiler, respectively. For example,
    \verbatim
./configure CXX=g++-8.0.0 CC=gcc-8.0.0 F77=gfortran-8.0.0
    \endverbatim

    In order to set the compiler flags, you should use the variables
    `CXXFLAGS`, `CFLAGS`, `FFLAGS`. Note, that the %Ipopt code
    uses `dynamic_cast`. Therefore it is necessary that the C++ code is
    compiled including RTTI (Run-Time Type Information). Some compilers
    need to be given special flags to do that (e.g., `-qrtti=dyna` for
    the AIX `xlC` compiler).

    <!-- TODO Please also check the [generic COIN-OR help page](https://projects.coin-or.org/CoinHelp/wiki/user-configure#GivingOptions)
    for the description of more variables that can be set for configure. -->

-   By default, the %Ipopt library is compiled as a shared
    library, on systems where this is supported. If you want to generate
    a static library, you need to specify the `--disable-shared` flag. If
    you want to compile both shared and static libraries, you should
    specify the `--enable-static` flag. This is no possible on Windows.

-   It is possible to compile the %Ipopt library in a debug
    configuration, by specifying `--enable-debug`. This switches the
    default compiler flags (CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FFLAGS) to instruct the
    compiler to include debug information into object files and disables
    compiler optimization.

    Also, you can tell %Ipopt to do some additional runtime
    sanity checks, by specifying the flag `--with-ipopt-checklevel`.

    This usually leads to a significant slowdown of the code, but might
    be helpful when debugging something.

    The checklevel value has the following effect:
    - &ge; 1 : enables asserts (DBG_ASSERT) and debug statements (DBG_DO)
    - &ge; 2 : floating-point exceptions divbyzero, overflow, and invalid are signaled (SIGFPE) while %Ipopt is solving (requires GLIBC)
    - &ge; 3 : checks in Ipopts caching and observer mechanisms are enabled
    - &ge; 4 : checks in Ipopts SmartPtr implementation are enabled

-   If you want to link the %Ipopt library with a main
    program written in C or Fortran, the C and Fortran compiler doing
    the linking of the executable needs to be told about the C++ runtime
    libraries. Unfortunately, the build system does not provide a
    functionality for automatic detection of those libraries. We have
    hard-coded some default values for some systems and compilers, but
    this might not work all the time.

    If you have problems linking your Fortran or C code with the
    %Ipopt library `libipopt.a` and the linker complains
    about missing symbols from C++ (e.g., the standard template
    library), you should specify the C++ libraries with the `CXXLIBS`
    variable. To find out what those libraries are, it is probably
    helpful to link a simple C++ program with verbose compiler output.

    For example, for the Intel compilers on a Linux system, you might
    need to specify something like
    \verbatim
./configure CC=icc F77=ifort CXX=icpc CXXLIBS='-L/usr/lib/gcc-lib/i386-redhat-linux/3.2.3 -lstdc++'
    \endverbatim

-   Compilation on an AIX 64bit system sometimes requires some special
    consideration. We recommend the following configuration
    \verbatim
./configure AR='ar -X64' NM='nm -X64' CC='xlc -q64' F77='xlf -q64' CXX='xlC -q64' CFLAGS='-O3 -bmaxdata:0x3f0000000' FFLAGS='-O3 -bmaxdata:0x3f0000000' CXXFLAGS='-qrtti=dyna -O3 -bmaxdata:0x3f0000000'
    \endverbatim
    (Alternatively, a simpler solution for AIX is to set the environment
    variable `OBJECT_MODE` to 64.)

-   %Ipopt's Java interface `JIpopt` uses the Java Native Interface (JNI),
    which is a programming framework that allows Java code running in the
    Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications
    and libraries written in languages such as C and C++.

    configure tries to find a Java compiler and the necessary compiler
    flags to locate the JNI header files automatically. You can influence
    this automated check by setting the environment variable `JAVA_HOME`
    to the directory that contains your JDK.

    \note The build procedure currently cannot deal with spaces in the path
    to the JDK. If you are on Windows and have Java in a path like
    `C:\Program Files\Java`, try setting `JAVA_HOME` to the DOS equivalent
    `C:\Progra~1\Java` (or similar).

    You can disable the checks for Java and build of the Java interface
    by specifying the configure flag `--disable-java`.
    This is also the default if `JAVA_HOME` contains a space or the build
    of shared libraries has been disabled as `JIpopt` needs to be able to
    load the %Ipopt library dynamically at runtime.

-   %Ipopt can load HSL or Pardiso libraries at runtime. To disable this
    feature, specify `--disable-linear-solver-loader`.

-   \ref SIPOPT "sIpopt" is build and installed together with %Ipopt. If
    you do not need sIpopt, you can disable it via `--disable-sipopt`.

Configure flags specific to the use of %Ipopt's dependencies were discussed
in the corresponding sections of \ref EXTERNALCODE.

\subsection CPP_FLAGS Additional Flags for Compiler Preprocessor

A few flags that influence which %Ipopt code is compiled are not controlled by parameters for configure.
We list some of these flags in the following.

\note These are flags for expert users.
  Usually, there should be no need to define these.
  Further, we may change or remove these flags without advanced warning.

- `IPOPT_THREAD_LOCAL`: Keyword to be used to declare a thread-local variable.

- `IPOPT_DEPRECATED`: Keyword to be used to mark a function as deprecated.

- `FUNNY_MA57_FINT`: If defined, then assume that `ptrdiff_t` corresponds to the integer type used by HSL MA57, e.g., 64-bit integers on 64-bit systems.
  This flag was useful when using MA57 from libraries that come with Matlab.

- `MA97_DUMP_MATRIX`: If defined, then option `ma97_dump_matrix` is available.
  This requires linking against a HSL library (not loading at runtime) that includes function `dump_mat_csc`.

- `MUMPS_DUMP_MATRIX`: If defined, then matrices are written to stdout in the MUMPS interface.

- `IPOPT_MUMPS_NOMUTEX`: If defined, concurrent calls of %Ipopt into MUMPS from different threads are not prevented by a mutex.

\section COINBREW Using CoinBrew

On sufficiently prepared systems, an alternative way to download, build,
and install %Ipopt with dependencies ASL, HSL, and MUMPS is to use the
coinbrew script from https://coin-or.github.io/coinbrew/

After obtaining the script, run

    /path/to/coinbrew fetch Ipopt --no-prompt
    /path/to/coinbrew build Ipopt --prefix=/dir/to/install --test --no-prompt --verbosity=3
    /path/to/coinbrew install Ipopt --no-prompt

The coinbrew script will take care of building and installing the
dependencies ASL and MUMPS before building %Ipopt.
To use HSL sources, change to the `ThirdParty/HSL` directory created by
`coinbrew fetch` and follow the download instructions (i.e., skip the build step)
from \ref DOWNLOAD_HSL. Then proceed with the `coinbrew build` step.

More details on using coinbrew can be found at the instructions on
[Getting Started with the COIN-OR Optimization Suite](https://coin-or.github.io/user_introduction).


\section INSTALL_R Compiling and Installing the R Interface ipoptr

The `ipoptr` interface can be build after %Ipopt has been
build and installed. In the best case, it is sufficient to execute the
following command in R:
\verbatim
install.packages('$IPOPTDIR/build/contrib/RInterface', repos=NULL, type='source')
\endverbatim

After installation of the `ipoptr` package, it should be possible to
load the package in R and to view the help page:
\verbatim
library('ipoptr')
?ipoptr
\endverbatim


\section SINGLEPRECISION_BUILD Building for single-precision floating-point arithmetic

%Ipopt by default uses double-precision floating point arithmetic.
Using the configure flag `--with-precision=float`, it is possible to build
a variant of %Ipopt that uses single-precision floating point arithmetic.
It is not possible to build for both single- and double-precision simultaneously.
In the single-precision configuration, the types Ipopt::Number and \ref ipnumber
are defined to be `float` and the C preprocessor variable `IPOPT_SINGLE` is defined in `IpoptConfig.h`.

If the %Ipopt code is compiled for single-precision, then also third-party
codes that interface with or are interfaced by %Ipopt need to support this
floating point format.
Regarding included code that interfaces to %Ipopt, the situation is as follows:
- \ref INTERFACE_CPP supports single-precision arithmetic by having Ipopt::Number defined as `float`.
- \ref INTERFACE_C supports single-precision arithmetic by having \ref ipnumber defined as `float`.
- \ref INTERFACE_FORTRAN supports single-precision arithmetic by using `real` instead of `double precision`.
  A single-precision variant of the HS071 example is available in `examples/hs071_f/hs071_fs.f`.
- \ref INTERFACE_JAVA supports single-precision arithmetic by using `float` instead of `double` for real numbers.
  A single-precision variant of the HS071 example is available in `examples/hs071_java/HS071s.java`.
  Note, that for the single-precision version of class `org.coinor.Ipopt`, all mention of `double` are replaced by `float` before compilation.
- \ref INTERFACE_AMPL "The AMPL interface" is not available when building for single-precision.
- \ref INTERFACE_R seems to work.
- Fortran and Java examples (other than HS071) and tutorials are not available for single-precision.
- \ref SIPOPT "sIpopt" is build in single-precision if %Ipopt is build in single-precision.

Regarding dependencies of %Ipopt, the situation is as follows:
- A single-precision variant of Blas and Lapack is required.
  Many implementations of Blas and Lapack include a single-precision variant.
  \attention macOS vecLib single-precision routines do not work as expected by gfortran.
  However, configure would still select the Accelerate framework by default and %Ipopt will try to run with faulty numbers.
  You may want to try switch to Lapack from HomeBrew instead (`--with-lapack-lflags="-L/usr/local/opt/lapack/lib -llapack -lblas"`) or try out [this vecLib wrapper](https://github.com/mcg1969/vecLibFort).
- The interface to MUMPS can use a single-precision version of MUMPS.
  See the [ThirdParty-Mumps docu](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-Mumps/#single-precision-codes) for details.
- The interfaces to the HSL routines can use single-precision versions of these routines.
  A current [ThirdParty-HSL](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-HSL) can compile these when using a [Coin-HSL](http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt) 2021.05.05 package.
- The interface for Pardiso (both MKL and from pardiso-project.org) is available.
  The Pardiso library contains a single-precision version of its solver.
- The interface to WSMP is not available.
- The interface to SPRAL is not available.

When building %Ipopt for single-precision arithmetic, the default for option \ref OPT_tol "tol" is changed to 1e-5.


\section INT64_BUILD Building for 64-bit integers

%Ipopt by default defines its types Ipopt::Index (C++) and \ref ipindex (C) to be `int`, which on many systems has a size of 32-bit.
This limits the size of problems to be solved to 2^31 variables, constraints, nonzero elements in matrices, etc.
Using the configure flag `--with-intsize=64`, it is possible to build a variant of %Ipopt that defines `Ipopt::Index`/\ref ipindex to be `int64_t`, i.e., an integer of size 64 bit.
Further, the C preprocessor variable `IPOPT_INT64` is defined in `IpoptConfig.h`.

Note that using 64-bit integers increases the memory usage of %Ipopt significantly since type Ipopt::Index is used for almost all integers in %Ipopt.
It is not possible to build for both 32- and 64-bit integers simultaneously.

If the %Ipopt code is compiled for 64-bit integers, then also third-party
codes that interface with or are interfaced by %Ipopt may need to support this
integer size.
Regarding included code that interfaces to %Ipopt, the situation is as follows:
- \ref INTERFACE_CPP supports 64-bit integers by having Ipopt::Index defined as `int64_t`.
- \ref INTERFACE_C supports 64-bit integers by having \ref ipindex defined as `int64_t`.
- \ref INTERFACE_FORTRAN supports 64-bit integers by using an 8-byte kind for `INTEGER`.
- \ref INTERFACE_JAVA does not support 64-bit integers because Java arrays can only be indexed by 32-bit integers.
  However, the Java interface can be used with 32-bit integers and an %Ipopt library that is build for 64-bit integers.
- \ref INTERFACE_AMPL "The AMPL interface" allows for problem instances with more than 2^31 nonzeros in Jacobian or Hessian.
  This requires that ASL has been build with `ASL_big_goff` defined (this define also need to be present in the ASL header files that the %Ipopt build includes).
  If using `ThirdParty-ASL`, then this achieved by selecting configure option `--with-intsize=64`, see also the [ThirdParty-ASL docu](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-ASL#jacobians-with-for-more-than-231-nonzeros).
  Note that problems instances are still limited to at most 2^31 variables and constraints - this is a limitation of AMPL or ASL.
- \ref INTERFACE_R does not support 64-bit integers because R only supports 32-bit integers.
  However, the R interface can still be used with an %Ipopt library that is build for 64-bit integers.
- \ref SIPOPT "sIpopt" supports 64-bit integers.

Regarding dependencies of %Ipopt, the situation is as follows:
- A variant of Blas and Lapack that uses 64-bit integers is required.
  If `--with-intsize=64` is seletected, then the check in configure by default only looks for Intel MKL and tries `-llapack64 -lblas64`, see also the [BuildTools docu](https://coin-or-tools.github.io/BuildTools/configure#check-for-lapack-with-64-bit-integers).
- The interface to MUMPS can use a version of MUMPS that has been compiled for 64-bit integers.
  See the [ThirdParty-Mumps docu](https://github.com/coin-or-tools/ThirdParty-Mumps/#64-bit-integers) for details.
- The interfaces to the HSL routines are not available.
- The interface for Pardiso from pardiso-project.org is not available.
- The interface for Pardiso from Intel MKL is available if the ILP64 variant of Intel MKL is used for Blas/Lapack.
- The interface to WSMP is not available.
- The interface to SPRAL is not available.
