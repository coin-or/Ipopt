The content of this directory and its subdirectories is not longer
maintained.  It used to provide the Developer Studio files for using
MS Developer Studio .NET 2003 in connection with the Intel Visual
FORTRAN compiler 8.1.  This is outdated, and instead we now maintain
the MS Visual Studio project for Ipopt in the

MSVisualStudio/v8/Ipopt

subdirectory of the base directory of the Ipopt package.
