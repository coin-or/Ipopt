Installation of certain Harwell subroutines for IPOPT.

*********************************************************************
Note: It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to ensure that you are entitled to
      download and use this third party package.
*********************************************************************

Information on the Harwell Subroutine Library (HSL) is available at

http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/nag/hsl/

Some of the required HSL routines are available in the HSL Archive.
The subroutines in the HSL Archive are free for non-commercial
purposes (make sure you read the license).

The sparse symmetric linear solvers that you can use in Ipopt are MA57
(if you have access for the standard HSL library) and/or MA27 (if you
have only access to the HSL Archive).  In addition, you should get
MC19 (from the ASL archive).


Instructions on how to download files from the HSL Archive:
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you need to download subroutines from the HSL Archive website, this
is how it goes:

In order to download the HSL Archive subroutines (like ma27 and mc19),
you need to register at the HSL Archive website

http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/archive/hslarchive.html

After that you can log in and go to the page that lists all the HSL
Archive packages for download.  If you then click on the name of the
desired routine (like MA27), you get to a download page, where one of
the button reads "Download Package (comments removed)".

Click on that button (leave the precision choice at default "Double
Precision").  This brings up a webpage which contains the code for the
subroutine as text.  All you have to do now is to save this page (all
of it, even if there are more than one subroutines in it) into the a
file called "ma27ad.f".  (If "Save page to..." doesn't work, you can
copy the content of this page into an editor and save it there.)

Similarly, if you want to get the MC19 routine, do the same steps as above
and safe the context in a file called "mc19ad.f" .

For neither MA27 or MC19 it is necessary to download any dependencies.

Instructions on where to put the source code:
---------------------------------------------

Copy the source files for the required HSL routines into this
directory before running the `configure' script.  The configuration
script will detect which source files you have and prepare the
Makefile accordingly.

If you want to use MA57, please make sure that all source code for
MA57 including dependencies is in a file called ma57ad.f
