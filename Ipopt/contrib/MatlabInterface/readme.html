<a name="install"><h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, I'll be assuming you have some sort of
UNIX-based operating system such as Mac OS X, Solaris or Linux. I'm afraid 
these instructions do not directly apply to the Windows operating system.
Hopefully you have enough experience with Windows to figure out how to
modify these steps for your setup. (If you are using 
Windows, I highly recommend that you check out the 
<a href="http://gnumex.sourceforge.net">gnumex</a> project website before
continuing.)</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll need to have a version of MATLAB installed on 
your computer. This software package has been
tested on MATLAB versions 7.2 through 7.7. It might very well work on
earlier versions of MATLAB, but there is also a good chance that it
will not. It is unlikely that the software will run with versions
prior to MATLAB 6.5.</p>

<h3>1. Install supported compilers</h3>

<p>The first thing you need to do is install
a C++ compiler and a Fortran 77 compiler. It is crucial that you use the 
precise compilers <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1601.html">supported 
by MATLAB</a>. For instance, on my Linux machine I have
MATLAB version 7.3, so the people at MathWorks tell me that I need to
have the <a href="href=http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc">GNU Compiler
Collection</a> (GCC) version 3.4.5. If you use the incorrect version
of GCC, you will likely encounter linking errors. The <b>mex</b>
command will tell you which compiler versions are legal.</p>

<h3>2. Configure MATLAB</h3> 

<p>Once you've installed the appropriate
compilers, set up and configure MATLAB to build MEX files. This is
explained quite nicely <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>3. Install IPOPT</h3>

<p>To install IPOPT, follow the <a
href="http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation">standard IPOPT
installation procedure</a> with a few small changes.</p>

<p>Usually, MATLAB demands that you compile the code with certain flags, 
such as <code>-fPIC</code> and <code>-fexceptions</code> on Linux. The
first flag tells the compiler to generate position-independent code,
and the second flag enables exception handling. Usually these flags
coincide with your MEX options file. You can figure out which flags are
used on your system by running the mex compiler with the
<code>-v</code> flag on a simple example source file (<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html#example1">Hello
World</a> is your friend). See <a
href="http://www.mathworks.com/support/tech-notes/1600/1605.html">this</a>
MathWorks technical support webpage for more information on the
MEX options file.</p>

<p>IPOPT attempts to automatically locate the directory where MATLAB is
  installed by querying the location of the <b>mex</b> executable. You can
  also manually specify the MATLAB home directory when calling the configure
  script with the flag <code>--with-matlab-home</code>.</p>

<p>In practice, you might find that it is easier to install and use the 
MATLAB interface by disabling compilation of the shared libraries, and use
only static libraries instead. This is achieved with the configure script
flag <code>-disable-shared</code>.</p>

<p>On a Linux machine with MATLAB 7.3 installed, the
call to the IPOPT configure script will look something like</p>

<p><code><pre>  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/ipopt/install      \
       CXX=g++-3.4.5 CC=gcc-3.4.5 F77=g77-3.4.5 \
       ADD_CXXFLAGS="-fPIC -fexceptions"        \
       ADD_CFLAGS="-fPIC -fexceptions"          \
       ADD_FFLAGS="-fPIC -fexceptions"</pre></code></p>

<p>I also installed the MATLAB interface to IPOPT on an Apple
computer running Mac OS X 10.3.9 and MATLAB 7.2. For this machine, I
ran the configure script with the following command:</p>

<p><code><pre>  ./configure --prefix=$HOME/ipopt/install                        \
    ADD_CFLAGS="-fno-common -fexceptions -no-cpp-precomp -fPIC"   \
    ADD_CXXFLAGS="-fno-common -fexceptions -no-cpp-precomp -fPIC" \
    ADD_FFLAGS="-x f77-cpp-input -fPIC -fno-common"               \
    FLIBS="-lg2c -lfrtbegin -lSystem"                             \
    F77=g77 CC=gcc CXX=g++</pre></code></p>

<p>After this, follow the standard installation steps: type
<code>make</code>, wait a few minutes, then <code>make install</code>
in the UNIX command line. This compiles all the source code into a
single library and places it in the install directory as specified by
the <code>prefix</code> variable above.</p>

<p>What we haven't yet done is compile the code for the MATLAB
interface. We'll do this next.</p>

<h3>4. Modify the Makefile and build the MEX file</h3> 

<p>Go to into the
subdirectory <code>Ipopt/contrib/MatlabInterface/src</code> and open
the file called <code>Makefile</code> with your favourite text
editor. You need to edit this file a little bit to suit for your system 
setup. You will find that most of the variables such
as <code>CXX</code> and <code>CXXFLAGS</code> have been automatically
(and hopefully, correctly) set according to the flags specified during
your initial call to <code>configure</code> script.</p>

<p>However, you may
need to modify <code>MATLAB_HOME</code>, <code>MEXSUFFIX</code> and 
<code>MEX</code> as explained in the comments of the Makefile. 
On one of our Linux
machines, we had set these Makefile variables to</p>

<p><code><pre>  MATLAB_HOME = /cs/local/generic/lib/pkg/matlab-7.3/bin/matlab
  MEXSUFFIX   = mexglx
</pre></code></p>

<p>Once you think you've set up the Makefile properly, type <code>make
install</code> in the same directory as the Makefile. If you didn't get
any errors, then you're pretty much all set to go!</p>

<p>There's a great possibility you will encounter problems with the
installation instructions we have just described here. I'm afraid some
resourcefulness will be required on your part, as the installation
will be slightly different for each person. Please consult the <a
href="#trouble">troubleshooting section</a> on this webpage, and the
<a href="http://list.coin-or.org/pipermail/coin-ipopt">archives</a>
of the IPOPT mailing list. If you can't find the answer at either of
these locations, try sending an email to the <a
href="http://list.coin-or.org/mailman/listinfo/coin-ipopt">IPOPT
mailing list</a>.</p>

<h3>5. Final steps</h3>

<p>If the installation procedure was successful, you
will end up with a MEX file. On a Linux machine, the MEX file will be
called <code>ipopt.mexglx</code>. In order to use it in MATLAB, you
need to tell MATLAB where to find it. The best way to do this is to
type</p>

<p><code><pre>  addpath sourcedir</pre></code></p>

<p>in the MATLAB command prompt, where <code>sourcedir</code> is the
location of the MEX file you created. (For more information, type <code>help
    addpath</code> in MATLAB. You
can also achieve the same thing by modifying the
<code>MATLABPATH</code> environment variable in the UNIX command line,
using either the <code>export</code> command (in Bash shell), or the
<code>setenv</code> command (in C-shell).</p>

<h2>Using the MATLAB interface</h2>

<p>There are several illustrative examples provided in the 
<code>Ipopt/contrib/MatlabInterface/examples</code> directory. The best way 
to understand how to use the interface is to carefully go over these 
examples.<p>

<p>For more information, type <code>help ipopt</code> in the MATLAB 
prompt.</p>

<h2>A note on 64-bit platforms</h2> 

<p>Starting with version 7.3, 
MATLAB can handle 64-bit addressing, and the authors of MATLAB have 
modified the implementation of sparse matrices to reflect this change. 
However, the row and column indices in the sparse matrix are converted to
signed integers, and this could potentially cause problems when dealing 
with large, sparse matrices on 64-bit platforms with MATLAB version 
7.3 or greater.</p>

<a name="trouble"><h2>Troubleshooting and known issues</h2>

<p>The installation procedure I've described does involve a certain
amount of expertise on the part of the user. If you are encountering
problems, it is highly recommended that you follow the standard
installation of IPOPT first, and then test the installation by running
some examples, either in C++ or in AMPL.</p>

<p>What follows are a list of common errors encountered, along
with a suggested remedy.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM: compilation is successful, but MATLAB crashes</h3>

<p>Even if you
didn't get any errors during compilation, there's still a possibility
that you didn't link the MEX file properly. In this case, executing
IPOPT in MATLAB will cause MATLAB to crash. This is a common problem,
and usually arises because you did not choose the proper compiler or
set the proper compilation flags (e.g. <code>-fPIC</code>) when you
ran the <code>configure</code> script at the very beginning.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM: MATLAB fails to link to IPOPT shared library</h3>

<p>You might 
encounter this problem if you try to execute one of the examples in 
MATLAB, and MATLAB complains that it cannot find the IPOPT shared 
library. The installation script has been set up so that the MEX file 
you are calling knows where to look for the IPOPT shared library.
However, if you moved the library then you will run into a problem.
One way to fix this problem is to modify the <code>LDFLAGS</code> 
variable in the MATLAB interface Makefile (see above) so that the 
correct path of the IPOPT library is specified. Alternatively, you 
could modify the <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code>
environment variable so that the location of the IPOPT library is
included in the path. If none of this is familiar to you, you might 
want to do a web search to find out more.</p>

<h3>PROBLEM: &quot;mwIndex&quot; is not defined</h3>

<p> You may get a
compilation error that says something to the effect that mwIndex is
not defined. This error will surface on a version of MATLAB prior to
7.3. The solution is to add the flag <code>-DMWINDEXISINT</code> to 
the <code>CXXFLAGS</code> variable in the MATLAB interface Makefile 
(see above).</p>
