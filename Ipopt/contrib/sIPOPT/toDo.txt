AmplTNLP
- rewrite get_suffixhandler as const

SensAmplTNLP
- errorcheck in get_number_suffix for NULL suffix
- remove get_bounds_info ?

AmplMeasurement
+ replace string operations by append_Index function

SchurData
+ try easy implementations for Multiply/Transmultiply in SchurData (see e.g. TransMultiply)
+ write functions that set the schurdata from z.b. arrays
+ write MakeNewCopy() functions for all implementations
+ write new constructor to make this easier
- Remove StdSchurData?
- exchange GetMultiplyingVectors by a transmultiply implementation that accepts pointers.
  (see StdPCalculator for the only use of this function) 

AsSensStepCalc
+ move InitializeImpl to the implementation!
- change boundchecking: instead of bound_check yes/no have option bound_check active_set/step_until_bound/none  which will then call the appropriate module. Make sure that active_set is only used in conjunction with the Schur algorithms

AsIndexPCalculator
+ use std::map instead of std::vector for PColumn list so it is easier to sort/find them

SchurDriver
+ write InitializeImpl

SensController
+ write InitializeImpl

SensApplication
- in function SetIpoptAlgorithmObjects: rewrite checking of consistency of inputs

SensTNLPAdapter
+ write inverse of ResortX in TNLPAdapter

MakeFile 
+ Remove AsSenscSetup if decided so

General
+ include print functions for all major classes. Allows deep testing
+ include #ifndefs in all new header files
+ make sure debug mode is switched on in every cpp file
- think about using the same ownerspace for all u-vectors - makes use of meta-data possible
+ decide on AsSenscSetup (decision made: get rid of it)
+ Add options to decide which Pcalc to use
+ Add options to decide which SchurData to use (this is in a lot of places...)
- Add options to decide which SchurDriver to use
+ All classes that have at least one virtual function should have virtual destructors
- Add assignment operator and copy constructor to all classes
- All these warnings with vector.size() comparisons?
- test with valgrind
- where does the function go that resets the SchurData??
- measure time for each action
- decent output at beginning and end
+ is SensAmplTNLP necessary to be given to SensApplication??
- the measurement class should go outside the library so everyone can/must write their own measurement class

Milestones
+ write a makefile.am and get it to compile as an add-on to ipopt with the new nlp structure.
+ write print functions and test schur calculation
