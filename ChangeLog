2008-02-28 releases/3.3.5
        - corrected links for Ipopt mailing list
        - added missing Makefile.in for Matlab interface
        - the addlibs* files are now installed in share/doc/coin/Ipopt
          instead of lib
        - updates in Matlab interface
        - bugfix for ticket #56

2007-12-27 releases/3.3.4
        - headers are now installed in include/coin
            (no longer in include/ipopt)
        - default for dual_inf_tol is now 1 (instead of 1e-4)
        - In matlab interface, here the text from Peter Carbonetto:
          There have been several significant changes made to the MATLAB interface since the last release. The most important two changes are: 1) Following the "warm start" feature of IPOPT, you may pass in initial estimates for the Lagrange multipliers. 2) Callback routines for computing the objective, gradient (etc.) are now specified using function handles instead of strings. (Thanks to Marcus Brubaker at the University of Toronto for the initial suggestion.) 

2007-09-25 releases/3.3.3
        - minor changes, bug fixes

2007-06-20 releases/3.3.1
        synchronized with all changes in trunk; probably more than to be
        remembered.  In the following a few:
        - support for Mumps linear solver (contributed by Damian Hocking)
        - --print-options flag for ipopt ASL solver executable to see all
          Ipopt options (available through ipopt.opt file)
        - added Matlab interface (contributed by Peter Carbonetto)
        - added support for f2c compiler to compiler Fortran code with
          MSVC++ compiler
        - new MSVisualStudio support (now within MSVisualStudio project
          and also with f2c)
        - a number of small changes/bug fixes/improvements
        - small change in interface (e.g., FinalizeSolution method)

2007-04-24 releases/3.2.4
        - updated download script for Blas to fit netlib's
          recent changes
        - using a more recent version of BuildTools

2006-11-29 release/3.2.3
        - updated download script for Lapack to fit to netlib's
          recent changes

2006-10-11 stable/3.2 r795
        - Bugfix in L-BFGS update
        - fix in configure with detection of sizeof(int *) on Cygwin

2006-07-14 - version 3.2.1 - dev release number 764
        - Bugfix in least square multiplier estimate.
          It mainly showed up in LBFGS with restoration phase as seg fault

2006-07-07 - version 3.2.0 - dev 757
        - changed installation procedure and directory structure to
          conform with new COIN-OR convention

2006-04-08 - version 3.1.0 - dev release number 714
        Several bug-fixes, improvements and additions. In particular:
	- new quasi-Newton approximation using L-BFGS
        - interfaces to linear solver MA57, WSMP, Pardiso
          (MUMPS and TAUCS not yet completed)
        - derivative checker
        - unit test
        - configure supports compilation under Cygwin with native
          Windows compilers
        - ScalableExample
        - user call-back method in TNLP

2005-12-04 - version 3.0.1 - fixes independent of dev
        (already taken care of there)
        Several corrections to Windows files
        Fix termination if number of iterations is exceeded in restoration phase
2005-08-26 - version 3.0.0 - dev release number 510
        First official release of the new C++ implementation of Ipopt.
