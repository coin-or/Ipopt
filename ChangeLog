2013-11-16 releases/3.11.6
        - updates to Matlab Interface build system (by T. Kelman)
        - fix to updates of R Interface [r2416, #223]
        - fixed SHAREDLIBEXT in v8-ifort's config.h [r2426, #224]
        - minor fixes to the buildsystem

2013-10-26 releases/3.11.5
        - added method IpoptApplication::RethrowNonIpoptException() to enable
          rethrowing of non-ipopt and non-bad_alloc exceptions catched in
          the *Optimize() and Initialization() methods; default is still to
          return with NonIpopt_Exception_Thrown status
        - minor fixes to the buildsystem [#215, #222]

2013-09-12 releases/3.11.4
        - hopefully fixed non-working linear solver loader in DLLs build with
          MSVS/v8-ifort project files [r2365]
        - allow MC19 to be loaded via linear solver loader (by J. Currie) [r2366]
        - fixed new point flag when running dependendency detector [r2368]
        - experimental: adapt Pardiso interface to work with MKL Pardiso
          (by J. Currie, T. Kelman) [r2369, #216]:
          - in a few tests it has been found that Pardiso from Intel MKL nowadays
            seems to work fine with Ipopt
          - to use Intel MKL with Ipopt 3.11, one has to specify the MKL libs via
            --with-pardiso and add -DHAVE_PARDISO_MKL -DHAVE_PARDISO_PARALLEL
            to the compiler flags
          - note that this is still an experimental feature (and thus not enabled
            by default)
        - updated Ipopt/R interface to version 0.8.4 [r2373]
          - additional variables have been included in the object returned from ipoptr:
            z_L : final values for the lower bound multipliers
            z_U : final values for the upper bound multipliers
            constraints : final values for the constraints
            lambda : final values for the Lagrange multipliers
          - removed ipoptr_environment as argument in ipoptr (see also r2372)
        - fixed bug in penalty term for centrality in quality function (not used by
          default) [#219, r2374]
        - minor bugfixes in AMPL interface, debug print statements, and compound matrix
          (by G. Hackebeil) [#218, r2371, r2377, r2378, r2379]
        - download scripts for ASL, Blas, and Lapack now first try to download tarball
          copies from the COIN-OR server

2013-08-08 releases/3.11.3
        - get.* scripts for ThirdParty/{ASL,Blas,Lapack} now work around broken
          ftp access to www.netlib.org.

2013-07-01 releases/3.11.2
        - changed default for option option_file_name to ipopt.opt; specifying an
          empty string for this option now disables reading of an option file [r2339]
        - missing initial values are now set to 0.0, projected onto variable bounds,
          in AMPL interface [r2340, #205]
        - fixed missing variable initialization in MA97 interface [r2341, #206]

2013-06-14 releases/3.11.1
        - the setup for the v8-ifort MSVS project changed to use dynamic runtime
          DLLs instead of static linking, which caused crashes in debug mode
          (by M. Roelofs) [r2301]
        - fixed memory leaks in Java Interface (by javier) [#200, r2312]
        - updates and fixes to MA77 and MA87 interfaces, adding support of
          HSL 2013 codes (by J. Hogg);
          HSL 2012 still supported when compiled with Ipopt, but the linear solver
          loader to dynamically load a HSL library at runtime now assumes HSL 2013
        - added option ma97_solve_blas3 (by J. Hogg) [r2329]
        - changed default for option ma27_meminc_factor from 10.0 to 2.0 [r2330]
        - fixed bug in ipopt_auxdata of MATLAB Interface related to iterfunc [r2325]

2013-05-07 releases/3.11.0
        - update and extension of Ipopt documentation
        - updated build of doxygen documentation to comply with other COIN-OR projects
        - localized global variables in TaggedObject and RegisteredOption,
          so that Ipopt should now be threadsafe as long as Ipopt objects
          (esp. SmartPtr's) are not shared between threads and a threadsafe
          linear solver is used (e.g., MA27) [#167]
        - no more need for whitespace character at end of options file
        - added options print_frequency_iter and print_frequency_time to regulate
          which iteration summary lines should be printed [#161]
        - function evaluation timings are now available in OrigIpoptNLP [#86]
        - some fixes to uncommon issues with the Ipopt SmartPtr [#162]

        - new build system for Harwell codes (ThirdParty/HSL), which requires
          the coin-hsl archives from http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/;
          previously downloaded HSL sources can still be used by placing them
          into ThirdParty/HSLold, but this option may be removed in a future
          Ipopt version
        - new interfaces for Harwell codes HSL_MA77, HSL_MA86, and HSL_MA97;
          see http://www.hsl.rl.ac.uk/ipopt/ about help on when to use which solver;
          especially MA57 and HSL_MA97 should be considered as replacement for MA27;
          however, MA27 is still the default for now
        - changed default of ma57_automatic_scaling to no (faster in general,
          but for higher reliability, you may want to set this option to yes)

        - major improvements for building the MATLAB interface (see documentation)
        - MATLAB interface now returns number of function evaluations, too
        - the MA57 interface can now be used with the MA57 library that comes with
          MATLAB (configure option --enable-matlab-ma57; cannot use Metis)
        - auxdata is now handled by a wrapper function ipopt_auxdata.m instead
          of internally within the mex code (replace Matlab call to ipopt with
          ipopt_auxdata if using auxiliary data in any callbacks) [r2282]
        - exposed more intermediate Ipopt information to iterfunc callback [r2283]
        
        - fixes to JIpopt buildsystem (now may work on windows and uses libtool)
        - JIpopt now reads options file ipopt.opt by default, if present
        - removed predefined KEY_ strings in JIpopt
        - renamed API functions that retrieve solution values in JIpopt
        
        - simplified installation of R interface

2013-05-05 releases/3.10.4

        - fixed bugs with reoptimizing a TNLP with all variables fixed [r2172, r2173, #179]
        - fixed more issues with sparse data structures and non-double numbers
          in Matlab interface (by T. Kelman) [r2191]
        - added missing final int for Ipopt return code Maximum_CpuTime_Exceeded
          in Java interface [r2216]
        - fixed bug when trying to warmstart Ipopt in Java interface [r2253]
        - fixed wrong use of SmartPtr's in Java interface [r2255, r2263]
        - fixed bug in returning final solution in Java interface [r2258]
        - included patch in ThirdParty/Mumps to work around bugs in Mumps
          matrix ordering routines AMF and QAMD (now give preference to AMD and METIS)

        - workaround problems with MacOSX-Lion's blas library
          (by Frederic Hetch) [r2102, #181]
        - the C interface now catches also Ipopt exceptions thrown
          within the OptimizeTNLP call and returns Ipopt::Unrecoverable_Exception
          as status [r2094, #144]
        - fixed segmentation fault in adaptive barrier parameter update rule
          when using the mehrotra option on unconstrained problems [r2114, #114]

        - changed to MUMPS version 4.8.3 in externals (Mumps developers
          seem to have removed 4.8.1).

2008-09-19 releases/3.5.3
        - changed back to MUMPS version 4.8.1 since there seem to be issues
          on Windows

        - several fixes, also from COIN Bug Squashing Party 2008

2008-07-18 releases/3.4.2
        - some bug fixes
        - added wallclock time routine
        - penalty function version does not longer crash if it
          wants to go to restoration phase (not that this really helps
          converence though)

        - some bug fixes
        - deleted v9 MSVC files again (since v8 works fine for v9)
        - print Ipopt version in default print level
        - added option that allows to change name of options file
          (option_file_name)

2008-04-25 releases/3.4.0
        - added support to dynamically load HSL or Pardiso:
          If Ipopt has been compiled without some HSL or Pardiso solver,
          it can now load those solvers from a shared library at runtime
          without recompilation.  This will make ditribution of binaries
          easier.  Does not work on all platforms yet.
        - several bugfixes
        - ensured compilation of MSVS project files (v8 and v9)
        - new special return code for square problems
          (Feasible_Point_Found returned if dual inf not small)
        - new initialization option for bound multipliers
          (see option bound_mult_init_method)
        - added simple penalty function line search option
          (line_search_method=penalty) - not guaranteed to converge, see
          Ipopt implementation paper (in MathProg)
        - some very basic method to approximate constraint Jacobian by
          finite differences (not efficient, but will hopefully be extended)

        - corrected links for Ipopt mailing list
        - added missing Makefile.in for Matlab interface
        - the addlibs* files are now installed in share/doc/coin/Ipopt
          instead of lib
        - updates in Matlab interface
        - bugfix for ticket #56

2007-12-27 releases/3.3.4
        - headers are now installed in include/coin
            (no longer in include/ipopt)
        - default for dual_inf_tol is now 1 (instead of 1e-4)
        - In matlab interface, here the text from Peter Carbonetto:
          There have been several significant changes made to the MATLAB interface since the last release. The most important two changes are: 1) Following the "warm start" feature of IPOPT, you may pass in initial estimates for the Lagrange multipliers. 2) Callback routines for computing the objective, gradient (etc.) are now specified using function handles instead of strings. (Thanks to Marcus Brubaker at the University of Toronto for the initial suggestion.) 

2007-09-25 releases/3.3.3
        - minor changes, bug fixes

2007-06-20 releases/3.3.1
