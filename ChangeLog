More detailed information for incremetal change can be found in the
history management of subversion.

2008-09-29 releases/3.5.4
        - changed to MUMPS version 4.8.3 in externals (Mumps developersi
          seem to have removed 4.8.1).

2008-09-19 releases/3.5.3
        - changed back to MUMPS version 4.8.1 since there seem to be issues
          on Windows

2008-09-18 releases/3.5.2
        - changed to latest version of MUMPS (4.8.2)
        - some bugfixes (linear algebra objects, automatic problem scaling)
        - made sure the subversion revision number is correct in all files
        - allowed general additional data and cq in IpData and IpCq

2008-08-26 releases/3.5.1
        - changed to latest version of MUMPS (4.8.1)

2008-08-25 releases/3.5.0
        - added ComputeRowAMax and ComputeColAMax methods to Matrix base class
        - changed externals for MUMPS to stable/1.1
        - call finalize solution in more failure cases
          (this means that AMPL writes .sol file in more situations)
        - added IpTNLPReducer as simple way to exclude constraints from problem
        - several fixes, also from COIN Bug Squashing Party 2008

2008-07-18 releases/3.4.2
        - some bug fixes
        - added wallclock time routine
        - penalty function version does not longer crash if it
          wants to go to restoration phase (not that this really helps
          converence though)

2008-05-30 releases/3.4.1
        - some bug fixes
        - deleted v9 MSVC files again (since v8 works fine for v9)
        - print Ipopt version in default print level
        - added option that allows to change name of options file
          (option_file_name)

2008-04-25 releases/3.4.0
        - added support to dynamically load HSL or Pardiso:
          If Ipopt has been compiled without some HSL or Pardiso solver,
          it can now load those solvers from a shared library at runtime
          without recompilation.  This will make ditribution of binaries
          easier.  Does not work on all platforms yet.
        - several bugfixes
        - ensured compilation of MSVS project files (v8 and v9)
        - new special return code for square problems
          (Feasible_Point_Found returned if dual inf not small)
        - new initialization option for bound multipliers
          (see option bound_mult_init_method)
        - added simple penalty function line search option
          (line_search_method=penalty) - not guaranteed to converge, see
          Ipopt implementation paper (in MathProg)
        - some very basic method to approximate constraint Jacobian by
          finite differences (not efficient, but will hopefully be extended)

2008-02-28 releases/3.3.5
        - corrected links for Ipopt mailing list
        - added missing Makefile.in for Matlab interface
        - the addlibs* files are now installed in share/doc/coin/Ipopt
          instead of lib
        - updates in Matlab interface
        - bugfix for ticket #56

2007-12-27 releases/3.3.4
        - headers are now installed in include/coin
            (no longer in include/ipopt)
        - default for dual_inf_tol is now 1 (instead of 1e-4)
        - In matlab interface, here the text from Peter Carbonetto:
          There have been several significant changes made to the MATLAB interface since the last release. The most important two changes are: 1) Following the "warm start" feature of IPOPT, you may pass in initial estimates for the Lagrange multipliers. 2) Callback routines for computing the objective, gradient (etc.) are now specified using function handles instead of strings. (Thanks to Marcus Brubaker at the University of Toronto for the initial suggestion.) 

2007-09-25 releases/3.3.3
        - minor changes, bug fixes

2007-06-20 releases/3.3.1
        synchronized with all changes in trunk; probably more than to be
        remembered.  In the following a few:
        - support for Mumps linear solver (contributed by Damian Hocking)
        - --print-options flag for ipopt ASL solver executable to see all
          Ipopt options (available through ipopt.opt file)
        - added Matlab interface (contributed by Peter Carbonetto)
        - added support for f2c compiler to compiler Fortran code with
          MSVC++ compiler
        - new MSVisualStudio support (now within MSVisualStudio project
          and also with f2c)
        - a number of small changes/bug fixes/improvements
        - small change in interface (e.g., FinalizeSolution method)

2007-04-24 releases/3.2.4
        - updated download script for Blas to fit netlib's
          recent changes
        - using a more recent version of BuildTools

2006-11-29 release/3.2.3
        - updated download script for Lapack to fit to netlib's

        - changed installation procedure and directory structure to
          conform with new COIN-OR convention

        Several bug-fixes, improvements and additions. In particular:
	- new quasi-Newton approximation using L-BFGS
        - interfaces to linear solver MA57, WSMP, Pardiso
          (MUMPS and TAUCS not yet completed)
        - derivative checker
        - unit test
        - configure supports compilation under Cygwin with native
          Windows compilers
        - ScalableExample
        - user call-back method in TNLP

2005-12-04 - version 3.0.1 - fixes independent of dev
        (already taken care of there)
        Several corrections to Windows files
        Fix termination if number of iterations is exceeded in restoration phase
