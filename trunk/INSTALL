This is just a short version of the installation instructions. You can

**********************************************************************
***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the Ipopt package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "CoinIpopt", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/Ipopt/trunk CoinIpopt

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/Ipopt and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip Ipopt-3.3.1.tgz
   tar xvf Ipopt-3.3.1.tar

   (Here "3.3.1" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

3. Ipopt requires some third party dependencies.  Please check the
   Ipopt documentation in

    Ipopt/doc/documentation.pdf

   or online at

    http://www.coin-or.org/Ipopt/documentation

**********************************************************************
***                        CONFIGURATION                           ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g.,
CoinIpopt or Ipopt-3.3.1).  Then you type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the Ipopt Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of Ipopt successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   Ipopt/examples/

subdirectory, see also the information at
