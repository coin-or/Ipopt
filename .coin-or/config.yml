  ShortDescription: A solver for general large-scale nonlinear continuous optimization.
  LongDescription: |2
    "Ipopt is an open-source solver for large-scale nonlinear continuous optimization.
     It can be used from modeling environments, such as AIMMS, AMPL, GAMS, or Matlab, and it is also available as callable library with interfaces to C++, C, Fortran, Java, and R.
     Ipopt uses an interior point method, together with a filter linear search procedure."
